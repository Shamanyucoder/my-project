Make a Person class with basic details (like name and age) and a method to show them.

Create a Student class that extends Person and adds extra info (like grade or course).

Create a Teacher class that extends Person and adds extra info (like subject or department).

Both Student and Teacher should have methods to show full details (using and overriding Personâ€™s method).

Finally, create examples of Student and Teacher to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.
