The page has a box that shows a product list

There is a dropdown menu where you can choose a category: All, Clothing, Electronics, or Books.

A list of products is stored in JavaScript (T-Shirt, Jeans, Headphones).

When the page first loads, it shows all products.

If you select a category from the dropdown, the list updates to show only products in that category.

The CSS part just adds styles (like borders, padding, and background color) to make it look neat.
